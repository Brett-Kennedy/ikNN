## Installation

`
pip install ikNN
`

## Description
An sklearn-compatable predictor that aggregates predictions from the set of all 2d subspaces, using a standard 
kNN algoritm within each 2d space. This allows typically similar accuracy as standard kNNs (in some cases higher and others lower, but typically similar), such as 
sklearn's, but improved interpretability, as the 2d spaces may easily be visualized. Further, it allows reducing the influence of less-predictive features. 

This predictor follows the standard sklearn fit-predict model. 

The tool also provides visualizations, allowing this to function as a highly interpretable model. 

## Example Notebooks
One example notebook is provided, Simple_Example_ikNN. 

## Example Python Files
One file is provides to evalutat the overall accuracy of the model.
